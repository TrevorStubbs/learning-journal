## Choosing a Text Editor
Choosing a text editor can be a vew personal experience. There are dozens of different text editors and Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). I have played with many different software suites and I have chosen to go with VS Code as my text editor through Code Fellows. I have been using Visual Studio for a few years now and I am pretty familiar with its features. It appears VS Code is just a simple version of Visual Studios. I plan to go through 102, 201, and 301 while bouncing between a windows machine and an Apple and since VS Code works with both I think it will be the best option for me. 

## Command line Tutorial
The command line is the developers view into their own computer. The command line can provide a much smoother workflow. It can be daunting for a first time user but with a little practice anyone can learn how to use it.

### Format
command [-option] argument
- `ls -l home/Documents`
### Cheat Sheet
- `pwd` - print working directory
- `ls` - what is in the location
    - `-l` long list option
    - `-a` Show hidden files
- `cd` - change directory

### Paths
- Relative Path - from the perspective of the current directory
- Absolute Path - from the perspective of root. 
- `~`(tilde) Shortcut to Home directory
- `/`(slash with no arguments) Shortcut to Root Directory
- `.`(dot) Reference current directory
- `..`(dotdot) Reference parent directory

## Space in names
- `'test something'` - Quotes can be used so you can use spaces
- `test\ something` - the `\`(back slash) is a escape character to tell the terminal to not pay attention to the next character.
