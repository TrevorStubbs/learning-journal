# Lab01: Setting up your accounts

Hello everyone. I'm Trevor (he/him). My background is in aviation, I have been a pilot for an airline for the last 12 years but my flying career has been halted due to COVID so here I am to learn a new skill. I have always been a windows user, I'm running Windows 10 Home Version 10.0.18362 Build 18362. I also have a 2015 Macbook Air which runs macOS Catalina Version 10.15.4, but I am not used to working in the macOS environment so I might as well learn now. I have been playing with computers my whole life but it feels like I've never really understood how these things work. I am ready to pop the hood and get my hands greasy.
