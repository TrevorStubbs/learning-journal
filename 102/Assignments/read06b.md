- A computer helps us with our thinking work
- they manipulate information

- 4 tasks of a comp
    - Input
    - store
    - process
    - output

- Input 
    - How the comp takes in what it needs to work on
- storage 
    - A place keep the inputs and data ready to be used for processing
- Processing
    - runs the calculations on the inputs and the stored data so its ready for use.
- Output 
    - the end result of the processing

- a bit is the smallest piece of info a comp can store. 
    - add millions of bits together and you can get a computer.

inputs and outputs is information.

"and" gates
"or" gates
"not" gates

Adders - here is a video on an adder made from [dominos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpLU__bhu2w)

### CPU Memory input & output
- inputs
    - mouse
    - keyboard
    - microphone

- Memory
    - Ram
    - Hard drive/SSD

- CPU
    - CPUs
    - GPUs

- Outputs
    - Monitors
    - speakers

### Hardware and Software
- Software controls the hardware.
- The OS is the master program.

### The Internet
- IP address
    - Internet Protocol
- DNS
    - DNS is a phone book
- they are scalable
