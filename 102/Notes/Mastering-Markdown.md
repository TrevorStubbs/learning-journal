# Mastering Markdown

## Text

- This is how you make something **bold**
    - __Can also be used to make bold__
- This is how you make something *italic*
    - _Can also be used to make italic_
- Links are made using [link to my github](https://github.com/TrevorStubbs).

## Lists

### Ordered lists
1. I am # one
1. I am number 2 (But I says I'm number 1)
1. I am number 3 (But I says I'm number 1)

## Imbedded Code

- Single lines of code can be imbedded by using: `if (isAwesome) => true;`
- Multi lines of code can be imbedded by using fencing:
```
if(isAwesome)
{
    return true;
}
```
- We can use syntax highlight using the language name:
```C#
if(isAwesome)
{
    return true;
}
```
