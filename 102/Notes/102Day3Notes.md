## Eric Meyer CSS Reset
- [css reset](https://github.com/TrevorStubbs/learning-journal/blob/master/Assignments/read05.md)
it takes away the browsers' built in CSS.

- `/* */` CSS comments syntax

there can only be 1 id
there can be multiple classes.
Classes are not element type specific.

`*{}` is the wild card. applies this to the whole website.

### Why CSS and JS in seperate files
- Code Maint
- Programmers are lazy
- Separation of concern

### CSS Reset
- gets rid of include browser styles

### CSS Seletor 
- a code block is the CSS rule
```CSS
ul {
    color: red:    
}
```
color:red - declaration
color - property
red - value

## Javascript

'use strict' forces JS to be more strongly typed.
