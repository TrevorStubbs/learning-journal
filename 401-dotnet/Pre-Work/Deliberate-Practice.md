### Learn anything
- You can be anything in life but you have to practice well.
    - You can try any new skill in an hour
    - You can learn some of the basics in 10 hours
    - You can become very good in 100 hours.
    - You can become amazing in most skills, if you spend 1000 hours of quality practice.

### What is Deliberate practice?
- Most effective method to rapidly improve any skill.
    - Intense structured practice on essential aspects of the task
    - Activities are designed for the sole purpose of effectively improving specific aspects of an individual's performance.
    - Goal is to push yourself beyond the current limits of your capacity
### Characteristics of Deliberate Practice
- Practice takes place outside of your comfort zone and requires a learner to constantly try things that are just beyond your current abilities.
- Practice involves well-defined, specific goals and often involves improving specific aspect of the target.
- Requires full attention and conscious actions. 
- There must be feedback and modifications of efforts in response.
- Usually involves building and modifying a previously learned skill.

### Requirements of the Learner
- Must be motivated to exert effort
- Should take in account your pre-existing knowledge.
- Receive immediate informative feedback.
- Repeatedly perform the same or similar tasks. 

### There is nothing magical about 10k Hours
- The real goal is progress.
- Improvement comes from how much you get out of each hour of practice. 
- The number of hours isn't important 
- You need to be committed to the practice.

### Find the joy in working hard
- It's a huge advantage to find the joy.
- Improvements can become fascination and obsession
- you may never find something boring.
- Find joy in the little details
- Take pride in trying to perfect every possible detail.

### Anything worthwhile take time and effort to achieve. 
### Repeating what you already know
- Deliberate practice doesn't have to be learning something completely new.
    - Polish what you already know.
- Try not to do anything automatically.
### Designing Deliberate Practice. 
- It's best with a coach.
- How to have deliberate practice without a personal coach
    1. ID the experts in the field
    1. Figure out what makes them so good
    1. Design practice around learning to do that yourself.
- 3 Fs
    - Focus
    - Feedback
    - Fix it
Practice has to be designed for you and your current place in your development.
### Ask yourself questions
- Before practice
    - How can I improve?
    - What exercises will help me learn this skill?
    - How can I invent my own exercises?
- During Practice
    - How am I doing?
    - What adjustments do I need to make?
    - Am I fully focused?
- After Practice
    - What went well?
    - How can I improve next time?
    - Was the exercises too easy or too hard?
    - How can they be adjusted?

## The Power of Yet vs Tyranny of Now
- Growth Mindset vs Fixed Mindset
- Praise wisely 
- yet can give confidence
- growth mindset builds equality

## Grit
- Passion and perseverance for long term goals. 
- Ability to learn is not set

## Redefining Success
- What do we do with career crisis
- Job snobbery
- We have so much hope for our careers
- We are full of envy
    - linked to spirit of equality
- Spirit of equality with deep real works inequality
- people's true value is unknown
- You can not be success at everything
- where is the element of loss.

## Imposter Syndrome
- Despite how much you achieved it doesn't matter and you are not good enough.
- 70% feel it sometime in their life.
- Comparing yourself to the 'norm' of the field

## How to think like a Programmer
- Finding a more effective way for problem solving.
- Best way is to have a framework and practice it
### Have  framework
1. Understand
    - Know exactly what is being asked. 
1. Plan
    - Don't dive right into solving the problem
    - You need to plan the solution
1. Divide
    - Do not try to solve one big problem
    - Divide the problem into smaller problems. 
    - If the smaller problem is still to big then divide that one into even smaller problems.
    - Connect the sub-solutions to solve bigger solutions
1. Stuck?
    - Take a deep breath
    - Debug:
        - Go step by step through the solution
    - Reassess:
        - Take a step back and try to look at the problem from another perspective.
    - Research:
        - Go find articles where other people have figured out a similar solution.
### Practice
- Don't expect to be great after just one week.

## Pretend That you are worth more
- Imagine If you time was worth $1000/hr
    - What would your life look like?
- Busyness is a sign of weakness
- Your time is like your paycheck
- Busyness and stress are the enemy
    - They are a sing you're off track.
- Be focused not busy
- Do not tolerate distractions
- You can do amazing things only if you have the time to do them

## What I wish I Knew Before I Learned to Code.
- Everyone Learns Differently
- It's ok to ask questions
- Everyone brings different skillsets
- This is a journey
