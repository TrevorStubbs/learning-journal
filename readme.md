### About Me:

Hi there, My name is Trevor Stubbs. I am a displaced aviation professional. I am here to learn how to design and build software that will make our lives easier.  I have been playing with computers my whole life but it feels like I've never really understood how these things work. I can't wait to get my hands dirty.
