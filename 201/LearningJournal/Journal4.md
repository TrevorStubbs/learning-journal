# Learning Journal 4
#### 4/30/20

I am motivated to learn something new each day. And if its not new I want to spend my day getting better at something I already know. Today was the first day I've ever pair programmed. Programming has always been a solo endeavor. It was fun to be able to work together with someone on an otherwise solo project. It stretched my communication ability and it forced me to formulate words on how to come up with a solution to a problem. Today was a positive experience for me.
