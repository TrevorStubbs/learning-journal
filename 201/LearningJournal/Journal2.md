I had pretty good success with today's assignment. At 1pm when lunch was over I didn't log into remo I just sat an read all the requirements for today's lab and I made sure I took notes to make sure I completely understood what I needed to do. While working on the project I kept on getting ideas on how to improve the design of my site but it kept on distracting me from making sure that the requirements of the assignment was met.

I also broke down the assignment to what was going to take me the most time. I started with getting the outline of the HTML down then I made the functionally of the JavaScript running then I spent the next few hours make all the CSS work for me. 

I think that was a good work flow for me.
