## Understanding the Problem Domain
- It's hard to learn more than 1 thing at once. 
- The guy uses the same problem when he is learning a new technology
    - I have been thinking of a timer app
    - or a dice rolling app

### Why are Domains Hard?
- It's hard to put together a puzzle if you don't know what it looks like.
- We need to find a way to see the big picture so we can put the pieces together

### Programming is Easy(ish) if you Understand the Problem Domain
- It's easy to build in an old waterfall approach
    - Tougher in agile

### What to do about it
- Make the problem domain easier
- Get better at understanding the PD.
- If it's to difficult to understand break it apart
